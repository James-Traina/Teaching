1.  Outline

2.  What are network effects? Definitions

    1.  Exist when user i’s willingness to pay for a product depends on how many others have adopted the same or compatible products. 

        When do these arise?

        Direct effects.

        Complements effects

​	Why does this matter?

Coordination games

1.  Chicken-and-egg problem
2.  Winner take all

3.  Direct vs Indirect effects

    “Direct” network externalities are common in communication protocols.

    Telephones, fax machines.

    Instant messaging, languages.

    Here user i cares directly whether user j adopts.

    User i might not care about others’ adoption per se, but does care through its effect on the supply of complements.

    Supply of movies on a particular format is influenced by popularity of the format.

    Software, music, etc.

4.  Game theory 1: network effects (coordination)

    1.  two NE
    2.  Prefer 'better' one

5.  Game theory 2: rivalry (two platforms, one better)

    1.  Now interpret outside option as other platform (or incumbent)
    2.  New platform better, but how to switch?

6.  Standards are valuable, Lock-in Effects

7.  Game theory 3: user adoption dynamics

    1.  Suppose player could commit
    2.  dynamic tree

8.  Game theory 4: Paying for adoption

    1.  Suppose you could change user payoffs

9.  Tipping

10.  Summary

     1.  Simple game framework makes clear that
         1.  “Good” technologies may not be adopted
         2.  The “best” technology may not be adopted
         3.  One user’s adoption choice depends on what he or she expects others to do (i.e., expectations play a big role!)
         4.  Firm success depends on **coordination**
     2.  Strategies include
         1.  Making decisions **sequential** (e.g., reaching early adopters, perhaps at nearly any cost)
         2.  **Subsidizing** early periods (e.g., trial periods, direct “bribes”)

11.  What does this mean for managers?

     1.  Coordination is crucial
         1.  Often better to be chosen than to be higher quality
         2.  Coordination efforts often more important than R&D
     2.  Strategic actions
         1.  Aggressively promote brand, product, use, interactions
         2.  Create and convince early adopters at nearly any cost
         3.  Subsidize in early periods and raise price later (i.e., trial periods and sign-up bonuses

12.  Takeaways

     1.  Demand-side scale economies
     2.  Themes:
         1.  Compatibility is valuable, standards emerge.
         2.  Competition becomes between standards.
     3.  Multiple equilibria: inertia, positive feedback.
     4.  New trade-offs: compatibility, openness.
         1.  Relationships w/other firms change.
         2.  Competitors and *complementors*.
