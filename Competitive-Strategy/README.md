# Competitive Strategy - BUSN 20900

This course applies microeconomics and game theory to analyze firm decision-making. We'll cover topics such as competitive advantage, entry, firm scope, and network effects. We'll split class time between lectures, case discussions, and student presentations. The course is entirely remote via Zoom: the lectures and discussions are live and recorded for later review. Attendance at all lectures and discussions is expected.

I've designed the course for students familiar with intermediate microeconomics and beginner game theory. Microeconomics is a requirement, and I'll assume prior proficiency. For game theory, I'll provide optional reading materials to get everyone up to speed. Students can contact me if they're unsure whether they have sufficient background for the course.

Cases include *Moneyball*, *The Cola Wars*, *Enterprise Rent-A-Car*, *Walmart vs. Amazon*, *Ritz-Carlton*, *Ryanair*, *NUMMI*, *McDonald's*, and *Nintendo and Sega*.
