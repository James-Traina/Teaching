# Industry Analysis

What makes an industry profitable?

## Michael Porter's Five Forces Framework

-   Underlying forces that make industries profitable are same across industries
    1.  Substitutability
    2.  Buyer Power
    3.  Seller Power
    4.  Competition with Incumbents
    5.  Competition with Entrants
-   Really an organization tool
    -   CS is messy, but at least we can sort what concepts go where
    -   Hard part in the real world: **quantifying which ones matter**

## Entry

-   Most important is generally **entry**, both actual and potential
    -   Looking across industries, **barriers to entry (BTE)** is the unifying feature of profitable industries
-   Firms actually create a lot of barriers to entry
    -   Not (always) nefariously...
-   This point is broadly applicable
    -   Lobbying
    -   Marketing
    -   R&D

## The Forces are Interconnected

We saw in the Cola Wars that marketing affects the other 5Fs, too

-   Substitutability (people love their Coke/Pepsi!)
-   Bargaining power (why weren't the bottlers profitable?)
-   Rivalry (this was the dimension on which they were competing)

## Consumer Welfare

-   So are these profitable activities that raise BTEs good or bad for consumers?
-   Use Cola Wars as an example, think through the pie diagram
    -   Marketing pushes out the demand curve for sodas, which increases the size of the pie
        -   Good for consumers
    -   Marketing increases the barriers to entry, which decreases the slice (%) for consumers
        -   Bad for consumers
    -   The net effect is ambiguous!
-   Other mechanisms are less ambiguous
    -   Generally think the 1st effect is bigger than the 2nd effect for R&D
    -   Generally think the 1st effect is smaller than the 2nd effect for lobbying

## OK, But What About Integration?

â€‹	$$\int No$$

-   We sidestepped a lot of discussion on integration in the Cola Wars
-   That's because we're saving that topic for Week 8!
    -   Though you can see that the 5F framework touches on a lot of things
    -   Later weeks are less messy -- deep dives into a single concept

## Side Note Example

-   For antitrust, biggest weakness of the 5Fs in practice is defining the relevant market
-   Entire merger cases are decided by arguing where to draw the line
-   See Whole Foods acquiring Wild Oats

## Takeaways

1. Five Forces helps organize thinking about why an industry is profitable
2. Profits = $f(rivalry, bargaining, ...)$
3. Most important force to understand sustained profits is **entry**
4. Firms create their own **barriers to entry** as a normal part of production
